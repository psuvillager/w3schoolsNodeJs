PROMISES
A  __ Promise __  is an object which represents an asynchronous task that 
will eventually finish. (https://medium.com/@rafaelvidaurre/truly-understanding-async-await-491dd580500e)


OBJECTS and their PROPERTIES
A JavaScript __object__ is made up of properties, which each have a name and serveral attributes (value, enumerable, configurable, and writable). You set a property's value like 'person.age = 35'.

  METHODS
  Methods are functions stored as object properties and are invoked like 'name = person.fullName()'; without parentheses, it will return the function definition.

CLASSES
Classes are emulated in Javascript with constructor functions like:
function Person(){
  this.name = 'Anna';
  this.age = 35;
}

THIS
The 'this' keyword is the object that "owns" the code. When used in an object, 'this' is the object itself.
In a constructor function 'this' does not have a value; it's a placeholder for any new objects created using the constructor, like person = new Person();

REGEXP
You can create RegExp object by using pattern literals /()/ instead of new RexExp().
