To do:

- Watchlist Demo
  - bring this code into the app for newFieldNotes, editFieldNote, and editWatchlist functionality

- Field Notes
  - show this view (and display counter) on click of newFieldNotes button and also on selection from the list of existing fieldNotes (passing fieldNotesID, which will be time-based like huntID)

- Hunt Overview
  - needs EventList display (Field Notes, Photos, and Harvests)
  		- linked field notes have watchlist instance w/ increment buttons, etc
  - needs new-event creation (Field Notes, Harvest, Take Photo)
 - enable event creation (Field Notes, Photos (requires service worker), and Harvests)
- Listeners
  - need to disregard clicks on uninteresting elements (to avoid showing blank screens)

- Handle database connection and storage
- Handle retrieval of Weather and Map in their respective views
- Make Signup and Login forms and handle auth/auth

- Build  the client-side architecture and coordinate with server

- Populate 'drawer'
