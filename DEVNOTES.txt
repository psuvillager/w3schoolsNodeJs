5/7/18 - Routing works 
5/8/18 - New Hunt view structure exists
5/10/18 - From New Hunt, makeNewHunt() populates Hunt Overview
5/14/18   But from Hunts List, chooseAndShowHunt() can't find match for huntID in globalHuntsList
          Demo data IDs are no longer hard-coded


To do:



  From Hunts List, __chooseAndShowHunt()__ should populate Hunt Overv
  (Related: updateHuntsList() and populateHuntOverview()) 


- Hunt Overview needs buttons for Field Notes, Harvest, Take Photo, Animal List, Map, Weather
- Make Field Notes objects and view, w/animal list (w/ increment buttons, etc.)

- Make Hunts List (w/ select details about hunts)
- Handle creation and display (on Hunt Overview) of Field Notes, Photos, and Harvests
- Enable editing the animal list from Hunt Overview (and grab list's data in each FieldNotes instance) 

- Handle database connection and storage
- Handle retrieval of Weather and Map in their respective views
- Make Signup and Login forms and handle auth/auth

- Build  the client-side architecture and coordinate with server

- Populate 'drawer'
- (Recreate hamburger and drawer without MDL library)
- Handle predictions and other longer-term features (see site plan)
